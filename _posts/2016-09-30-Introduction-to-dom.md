## A New Post

1. We can find analogies to the concept of the DOM and a DOM tree in our daily lives. For instance, a DOM tree is like a hierarchy of employees in a company with the CEO (a node) at the top of the tree while the employees (more nodes) fill out the tree, progressively connected to their superior (nodes) at the top. Provide another such analogy clearly describing the hierarchy and the nodes in it.

2. From the discussion about DOM, we see that it helps developers by providing an access mechanism to manipulate web pages and helps browsers render web pages faster. Can you list two possible disadvantages of using the DOM and why? You can refer to any resources online to come up with a suitable response.

3. XML is another markup language that is very similar to HTML. Research the difference between XML DOM and HTML DOM (if there is any). Justify your reasoning with examples.
